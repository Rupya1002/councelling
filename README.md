   - 🔢 Your rank
   - 🚻 Gender (Gender-neutral or Female-only)
   - 🏛️ Institute types (IIT/NIT/IIIT/GFTI)
   - 🔁 JoSAA Round
3. Click **Submit**.
4. View a table showing:
   - Institute Name  
   - Branch  
   - Category  
   - Seat Type  
   - Round  
   - Closing Rank

### Why Use It?
- To find **where a branch like CSE is available** at your rank
